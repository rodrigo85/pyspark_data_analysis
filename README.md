# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Route and Capacity Analysis

This project aims to analyze flight routes, aircraft capacity, and traffic patterns using data from Delta tables stored in Amazon S3. 
By leveraging visualizations such as Sankey diagrams and treemaps, the project provides insights into flight capacity rates, major flight routes, and airport traffic distribution. 
The analysis can be used to support decision-making in route optimization, load management, and resource allocation for airlines and airports.
